My project in Java is about a Zoo and it is structured like this:
-it has 6 classes and 2 interfaces
-The classes are called OwnerZoo, Animals, Zookeeper, Doctors and Visitors
-The interfaces are called BirthGiving and Human
-The Zookeeper class contain an object of type OwnerZoo and an array of type Animals
-The OwnerZoo class contain a String variable which represents the name of the owner of the zoo
-The Visitors class contain a variable of type int which represents the age of the visitor of the zoo
-The Animals class contain 1 variable of type String and 2 of type int which reperesents the species of the animal, the number of legs and its weight 
-The BirthGiving interface is used by Animals and Doctors class to make a difference between the species of animals
-The Human interface is used by Visitors class to be able to see if the visitor is a child,teenager, an adult and a senior
Also my project has a menu with 11 cases which allow the input to see for each case the result of the case
